the previous homework assignments (git repo with Makefile), answering
the questions by adding a text or a \LaTeX\ file to your repo.

% ****************************
\begin{enumerate}
% --------------------------

\item {\bf MPI ring communication.}  Write a distributed memory
  program that sends an integer in a ring starting from process 0 to 1
  to 2 (and so on). The last process sends the message back to process
  0. Perform this loop $N$ times, where $N$ is set in the program or
  on the command line.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Start with sending the integer 0 and let every process add its
    rank to the integer it received before it sends it to the next
    processor. Use the result
    after $N$ loops to check if all processors have properly added
    their contribution each time they received and sent the message.
  \item Time your program for a larger $N$ and estimate the latency on
    your system (i.e., the time used for each communication).  If you
    have access to the CIMS network, try to test your communication
    ring on more than one machine such that communication must go
    through the network.\footnote{See the computing \@ CIMS
      information sheet posted in the first week of the class
      on how to use multiple hosts when using \texttt{mpirun}. Note
      that on each host, the same compiled file must be available,
      i.e., they need to have a shared directory such as the home
      directories in CIMS.} If you
    use MPI on a single processor with multiple cores, the available
    memory is logically distributed, but messages are not actually
    sent through a network.\footnote{It depends on the implementation
      of MPI how it handles sending/receiving of data that is stored
      in the same physical memory.}
  \item Hand in your solution using the filename \texttt{int\_ring.c}.
  \item Modify your code such that instead of a single integer being
    sent in a ring, you communicate a large array of about 2MByte in a
    ring. Time the communication and use these timings to estimate the
    bandwidth of your system (i.e., the amount of data that can be
    communicated per second).
  \end{itemize}


\item {\bf Provide details regarding your final project.}
  Provide a more detailed list/table of what tasks you have done and are planning on
  doing for your final project, including an estimate of the  week
  you will be working on each task, and who will work on it. We are
  thinking of something like this:

    Week & Work & Who  \\ \hline \hline
    04/15-04/21 & Read paper underlying idea and think about
    algorithm & Richard, Erlich \\ \hline
    04/22-04/28 & More literature search and sketch MPI parallel

    04/29-05/05 &  Implement basic MPI functions, update profs on
    status, ask for help in office hours, write tests to verify
    implementation & Erlich\\ \hline
    05/06-05/12 & Finish implementation, fix remaining bugs,
    experiment with compression capability, time permitting: write
    CUDA kernel & Richard, Erlich \\ \hline
